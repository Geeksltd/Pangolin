## Locators

This is a very important concept, and a key differentiator of Pangolin from other UI testing tools. On web pages, there can be multiple elements all corresponding to the same label or textual representation. For example you might have multiple buttons named "Save" on the same page, for different forms. To disambiguiate your purpose, in most UI testing frameworks, you have to use exact CSS selectors or hard-code element IDs and Names. That makes your test code fragile and brittle, as every time that a small implementation detail is changed, your test will break.

But in Pangolin
