# CheckMailBox("email address")



The 'CheckMailBox' command accesses the email queue items in an application. This is basically a list of all the emails sent from the system to a specified email address. Typical scenarios that this command may be used is to receive registration confirmation links and password resetting instructions. After this, you can interact with the modal (pop up) window with the usual Pangolin commands.
