# ExpectNoHeader("text")



This command searches the current page in focus to ensure that a HTML header with the text contained in
quotation marks is not found. The "ExpectNo" prefixed commands are commonly used to test scenarios where we are testing a failure scenario or if the business logic dictates that something should be unavailable to users in certain real world scenarios.
